## What is a DAOIP?

DAOIP stands for DAO Improvement Proposal. A DAOIP is a design document providing information to the DAO ecosystem, or describing a new feature for DAOs or their processes or environment. The DAOIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The DAOIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

As of February 26, 2023, the DAOIP system is currently being specified while work continues on specific DAOIPs. Our goal in specifying the DAOIP system is to create a system that is both open and permissionless (as with EIPs and BIPs) but which also benefits from more professionalized, programmatic support for writing and governing certain key standards (as with W3C and ISO standards, but also similar to how EIPs operate with respect to "core" standards).

In the absence of additional direction, please follow the norms of the [EIP system](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md).

## DAOIP Rationale

We intend DAOIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community technical input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into DAOs. Because the DAOIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

For DAO implementers, DAOIPs are a convenient way to track the progress of their implementation. Ideally each implementation maintainer would list the DAOIPs that they have implemented. This will give end users a convenient way to know the current status of a given implementation or library.

## DAOIP Types

There are currently two different types of DAOIPs: Meta and Standard.

## History

This document was derived heavily from [Ethereum's EIP-1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md) by Martin Becze and Hudson Jameson, which in turn was derived from [Bitcoin's BIP-0001](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) written by Amir Taaki, which in turn was derived from [Python's PEP-0001](https://peps.python.org/). In many places text was simply copied and modified. The authors of these documents are not responsible for its use in the DAO Improvement Process, and should not be bothered with technical questions specific to DAOs or DAOIPs. Please direct all comments to the DAOIP editors.
